# BankingFilter
<br>**Description**
<br>This is a small bit of code that I wrote while being part of Enactus MÃ¼nster e.V. It logs the user in automatically with selenium, before downloading the history of banking transactions as a csv file. This csv File is then filtered for relevant transactions.
